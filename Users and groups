Users and groups:
                 - Linux was assigned to allow more than one user to have access to the system at the same time.
                 - In order for this multiuser design to work properly, there needs to be a method to protect users from each other. 

Groupadd: In linux there can be many users of a single system.
          groupadd command is used to create a new user group.
          Example:
          sudo groupadd developers
          To verify that the group has been created command is :
          sudo tail /etc/group
Useradd: 'Useradd' command is low level utility that is used for adding user account in linux.
          useradd command used to create new user account.
          Example: 
          useradd developer 
          We add a new user in linux with user add  command its gets created in locked state and to unlock that user account we need to set password.
          command: $ passwd developer
                   changing the password for user developer
                   new password:
                   Retype new password:
Usermod: user mod command used to change the attribute of already exist user account.
         Syntax:
         $ usermod[options] username
         Ex. usermod -d developers
                   
To switch the user command is :
"su -username"
