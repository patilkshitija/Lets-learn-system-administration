Storage:
 -Linux has robust systems and tooling to manage hardware devices, including storage drives. 
 -In this article we’ll cover, at a high level, how Linux represents these devices and how raw storage is made into usable space on the server.
What are Disk Partitions?
 -Disk partitions are a way of breaking up a storage drive into smaller usable units.
 -A partition is a section of a storage drive that can be treated in much the same way as a drive itself.
 
 MBR:
 MBR is the traditional partitioning system, which has been in use for over 30 years.
 Because of its age, it has some serious limitations. 
 Because of this, the fourth partition is typically set up as an “extended partition”, in which “logical partitions” can be created. 
 This allows you to subdivide the last partition to effectively allow additional partitions.
 
 GPT:
 GPT is a more modern partitioning scheme that attempts to resolve some of the issues inherent with MBR.
 Systems running GPT can have many more partitions per disk. This is usually only limited by the restrictions imposed by the operating system itself.  
 GPT can also write a “protective MBR” which tells MBR-only tools that the disk is being used.
 In most cases, GPT is the better choice unless your operating system or tooling prevent you from using it.
 
 Steps to create a partitons:
  1. List of partitions                      -> parted -l
  2. Lable a partitions                      -> parted/dev/vdb mklabel msdos
  3. Use mkpart to make a partiton           -> parted/dev/vdb -> p mkpart ->primary-> xfs->2048s ->1000MB ->p ->quit                                                                                                                 
  4. Let the partition be created/setteled   -> udevadm settle
  5. Attach the file system to the partition -> mkfs.xfs/dev/vdb
  6. Create a mount point directory          -> df -h ->mkdir /archive
  7. Add entry in fstab                      -> cat/etc/fstab -> lsblk/dev/vdb -> lsblk --fs/dev/vdb -> vi/etc/fstab
  8. System daeman - reload                  -> mount/archive/ ->df -h ->cd/archive/ ->ls ->touch file.txt ->ls -> history
  9. Mount the partition on the directory
  

  Some commands as follow:
  1. Lsblk --fs/dev/vdb  - list block with UUID
  2. parted -l           - list partitions
  3. parted/dev/vdb mklabel msdos - make label to a partion
  4. mkpart              - create a patition 
  5. udevadm settle      - wait till partition is registered successfully
  6. mkfs.xfs/dev/vdb1   - format file system with XFS file system
  7. systemctl daemon-reload - restart daemon service
