 Basic file permission 
 permission groups:
 -owner :The owner permissions apply only the owner of the filr or directory.
 -group :The group permission apply only to the group that has been assigned to the file or directory.
 -all users :The all users permission apply to all other users on the system. 

Permission Types:
1. Read : Allows the contents of the file to be viewed.Read permission allows you to list the contents of the directory
2. write : Allows to modify the contents of that file.
3. Execute : Allows you to runt the file and execute a program or script.

To view the permissons on file or directory the command is :
         ls -l <directory/file>
Sample output of the ls command : 
         -rw-r--r-- 1 root root May 07 05 21 /etc/passwd
         The 1st dast(-) indicates type of file (d for directory,s for special file, - for a regular file).
         The next 3 characters (rw-)defines the owners permission to the file In this example the file owner has read and write permission only.
         The next 3 characters (r--)  permission for the members of the same group as file owner(read only}
         The last 3 characters (r--) permission for the other users(read only)
         
The numbers are binary representation of the rwx string.
r=4
w=2
x=1
So set a file to permission on file to read -rwxr----- you would enter "chamod 740 file".

chown command to change owner and group assignments,the sytax is:
chown owner:group filename
So to change the owner of the file to user and group to family you enter
chown user:family file.
